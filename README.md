"week-two-js-moringa"
#
This is my second assignment project as I take on learning html.
In this assignment, I have created a Calender that allows a user to input day, month, year and Gender. <br>

<br>
A brief description of the project. <br>
The calender then correctly calculates the day when one was born and goes further to convert it to the Ghanaiancultural names for days when oen is born. The people of Ghana have a name given to a boy or girl born on a certain day of the week<br>
<br>
The project is setup to allow step by step progression in the process of development and linking of js, html and css files and finally deploying the complete page to the github pages. This provides an excting means of learning and growing. <br>
